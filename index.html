We drove down and were joined in this adventure by Kate, Ben and Luna who stayed with us, and by Paul's brother Tony, Gillian and their son Elliot and his partner Judi who were nearby within the resort. The others skied every day however after just three tentative lessons Julie fell and injured her knee, requiring assistance to walk, crutches and a brace. </p>

				<h2>Paul is intolerant</h2>

				<p class='story'>In February, Paul was diagnosed with gluten intolerance which has meant quite an adjustment to his diet. There are many gluten free options but alas now many foods that are just not suitable. Beer, for instance, is off the menu. It's just as well tha Paul enjoys wine and many cocktails. Travelling overseas may be quite the challenge, though there are schools of thought that due differences in processing, European breads and pasta might be safe for consumption. We'll see.</p>
