Plus, Max has released a solo Christmas album with support from his friend Yann. It is highly recommended as perfect listening for the holiday season and beyond. </p>
				<p>In recognition of his output as a professional musician, Maxwell has acheived the status of "un intermittent du spectacle" which affords him a regular income over the full year.</p>
				<p>Recording has started on an eagerly anticipated second album with Le SuperHomard and Maxwell is writing and composing a third album for Dewaere.</p>
